// If you use Git source control, this file will be used

// where you download every branch to disk, you'll need to
// copy this into each branch

// Tip: Use Git (via TFS), it uses the concept of a single local repo on disk
// which is sync'd to any branch of this, and crucially it adds an extra
// 'local' check-in, before you push changes to the server. It allows you 
// to check in (broken) code as you go. without affecting the team,
// and therefore giving you lots of local history to rollback to, etc
